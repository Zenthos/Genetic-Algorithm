# Genetic_Algorithm
Arrow Vectors utilize a genetic algorithm to navigate through a 2D plane in an attempt to reach a red target

## Updated

- Switched from static rectangles to dynamic Arrow Vectors
- Implemented the pymunk physics engine
- Improved fitness and collision functions

#### To-Do List

- Optimize program to improve performance (FPS Drops dramatically after 60-70 Generations)
- Modify genetic algorithm to improve learning rate
- Add obstacles to increase complexity of the problem
- Clean up code and remove extraneous lines
- Fix remaining bugs
